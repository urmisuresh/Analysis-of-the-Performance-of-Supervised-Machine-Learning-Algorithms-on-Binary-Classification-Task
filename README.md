This paper explores the process and results of a small replication of the analysis done in the paper by Caruana & Niculescu-Mizil (CNM06), with the purpose being to evaluate a few different supervised learning algorithms and determine if any of them outperform the others at binary classification. The performance of four various learning algorithms on four data sets are measured by three different metrics: accuracy, AUC, and F1 score. The algorithms performed are support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forests. Overall, random forests consistently outperforms the other models, matching the results of CNM06.
